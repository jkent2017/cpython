Up until 20 March 2020, Brendan focused on modifying the datetime library of Python. Due to how ingrained the aspect he wanted to change was,
and not desiring to rewrite most of the library to incorporate this one feature, he shifted forcuse to the calendar library.

The calendar library does allow for the feature he wanted to add to the datetime library, but the method in which BCE dates are handled
is odd. 1 BCE is treated as year 0 in calendar, with all subsequent BCE dates being +1 the negative number. 10 BCE is -9, for example.

The calendar library also does not have much support for multiple types of calendars, instead opting to have features relating to
gregorian, and it would also take rewritting most of the library to have BCE dates line up with their respective negaitve number,
such as -10 being 10 BCE.

As of 25 March 2020, Brendan has opted to create a new library to have the features he desires, without the need to rewrite
entire libraries, as well as adding functionality to Python that allows for conversions between multiple types of libraries
and features specific to each library.

As of right now, he only has the main feature he wanted to add to datetime in caltype, his custom library.
